# PhotonSlicer

The PhotonSlicer Converts STL (binary) files to Images or PhotonFile. It is programmed in Python 3 and uses Cython (fast compression / mesh calculations), OpenCV (image drawing routines) and numpy (handling large image data).

---

## Status

Not yet ready:
- Real life test with the produced photon files have to be done.

---
  
## Installation

It has two install folders: 'Console/' with a Command Line Interface and 'Win64/' with a graphical interface. The last one is most suitable as plugin for MeshMixer. Both contain split zip archives.

For Linux and OSX you have to install python and some libraries (cython, numpy, open-cv). 

For Linux/MeshMixer user: You should already have wine up and running to use MeshMixer. You should install the Win64/ Zip files for PhotonSlicer in Wine too. 

---

## Setup MeshMixer
1. Install MeshMixer (Linux users: First install Wine and install MeshMixer in Wine)
2. Download and unpack the zips in /Win64 (use 7-zip) to a location on your computer e.g. C:/Program Files/PhotonSlicer/
3. Open MeshMixer
4. Go to menu File > Preferences (Alt-T)
5. Go to tab Printers
6. Choose Add
7. Fill fields as follows: 
    - Manufacturer: 'Anycubic'
    - Model: 'Photon - MC Rapid Clear' or append your own resin brand/type names
    - Width: '65.00'
    - Depth: '115.00'
    - Height: '155.00'
    - Printer software name : 'Photon Slicer'
    - Printer software path : 'C:/Program Files/PhotonSlicer/PhotonSlicer.exe'
    - Format of file to ... : 'STL'
    - Command line artuments: '-g True -f False -e folder -l 0.05 -o 6 -t 8 -be 90 -bl 8 -p "C:/Program Files/PhotonSlicer/STLs/photon" -s'      
8. Close window 'Printer Properties'
9. Close window 'Preferences'

You can add an extra 'printer' for each resin / settings combo you need.


## Use MeshMixer to Slice
1. Open an STL file, check if fits the build volume and is not below it.
2. Press 'Print' icon on bottom of left toolbar.
3. A progress windows appears.
4. The folder with your photon file opens

If you don't see a progress window and now file is added to 'C:/Program Files/PhotonSlicer/STLs/photon' check 'C:/Program Files/PhotonSlicer/log.txt' for error messages.


## MeshMixer Full Workflow 

1. Open an STL file, check if fits the build volume and is not below it.

6. Press 'Print' icon on bottom of left toolbar. A progress windows appears.
7. The folder with your photon file opens

## Functionality under development
- The main focus is speed.
- Since PhotonSlicer was mainly meant as a plugin, mesh editing (hollowing/infill/positioning) will not be developed. Use the functionality of MeshMixer instead!

                       [-e EXECUTE]

required: stlfilename

examples: PhotonSlicer.exe -s ./STLs/Cube.stl                         -> ./STLs/Cube.photon
          PhotonSlicer.exe -s ./STLs/Cube.svg                         -> ./STLs/Cube.photon
          PhotonSlicer.exe -s ./STLs/Cube.stl -p photon -l 0.05       -> ./STLs/Cube.photon
          PhotonSlicer.exe -s ./STLs/Cube.stl -p /home/photon -l 0.05 -> /home/Cube.photon
          PhotonSlicer.exe -s ./STLs/Cube.stl -p /Sqrs.photon -l 0.05 -> /Sqrs.photon
          PhotonSlicer.exe -s ./STLs/Cube.stl -p images -l 0.05    -> ./STLs/Cube/0001.png,..
          PhotonSlicer.exe -s ./STLs/Cube.stl -p ./sliced/ -l 0.05 -> ./sliced/0001.png,..
          PhotonSlicer.exe -s dialog -p dialog -g True -f False    -> full GUI is used
